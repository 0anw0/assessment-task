## Base dependencies

- [react-native-fast-image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image)
  # cached optimized images
  the community package (react-native-fast-image from @DylanVann) provides more performant images. 
  Every image in the list is a new Image() instance. The faster it reaches the loaded hook,
  the faster your JavaScript thread will be free again.
